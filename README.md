# mkRebuild

**Purpose**:
To creat a mechanical keyboard that can be taken apart and rebuilt over time to fit whatever need the user wants. So everything needs to be mostly solder free and layout independant. 



___

**Phase 01 - In Progress**
 * Model and 3D Print a simple case to hold all the components together
 * 2x2 Matrix Button Scan
 * Use a Joystick for mouse movements
 * Use a rotary encoder for scroll wheel
 * Write all the code needed to get a basic keyboard and mouse working with a teensy 3.2 board.
 * [Youtube :: Phase1 Update 01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWuwZhQK03g)


**Phase 02 - Waiting**
 * 7x5 Button Matrix (Half a keyboard, maybe try a one handed keyboard)
 * Program 3 different levels, Lower, Upper and Shift.
 * Lower will be user programmable macros, Save data to EEPROM on the Teensy
 * 3D print new case

**Phase 03 - Waiting**
 * 14x5 Buttion Matrix
 * Try a Planck style layout for the first fully built keyboard
 * Add mouse functionality back
 * Add Multi level with persistant macros on the lower level

**Future Possible Upgrades**
 * Bluetooth Support with rechargable battery
 * Split Keyboard Layout
 * USB Hub built into keyboard
 * Staggered Layout
